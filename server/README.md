  **Moonlight** is the source-code of a Maplestory GMS v214 private server, including an authentication hook and launcher.

  This is, of course, based upon Swordie's v214 source, so credits go to their phenomenal development team.

## Disclaimer
I'm extremely interested in learning about the development of private servers, including client edits, wz editing, and server-sided security to deter hackers and client/wz editors.

I do not guarantee that this will go anywhere, but I hope that it does!

> 'Moonlight' is a temporary working name for this project, which is due to change later on down the line.
