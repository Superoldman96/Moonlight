  - Encrypted on our server; we can never see what your IP is
- **Your Account Credentials**
  - **Your username**
    - Stored in plaintext as it doesn't need to be encrypted
  - **Your password**
    - Encrypted on our server; we can never see what your password is

Please give us time to get used to the source-code and implement the necessary privacy and security changes for you guys.
